/// Async adapter for I/O types.
///
/// This type puts an I/O handle into non-blocking mode, registers it in
/// [epoll]/[kqueue]/[event ports]/[wepoll], and then provides an async interface for it.
///
/// [epoll]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoll
/// [kqueue]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kqueue
/// [event ports]: https://illumos.org/man/port_create
/// [wepoll]: https://github.com/piscisaureus/wepoll
///
/// # Caveats
///
/// The [`Async`] implementation is specific to the threadshare implementation.
/// Neither [`async-net`] nor [`async-process`] (on Unix) can be used.
///
/// [`async-net`]: https://github.com/smol-rs/async-net
/// [`async-process`]: https://github.com/smol-rs/async-process
///
/// ### Supported types
///
/// [`Async`] supports all networking types, as well as some OS-specific file descriptors like
/// [timerfd] and [inotify].
///
/// However, do not use [`Async`] with types like [`File`][`std::fs::File`],
/// [`Stdin`][`std::io::Stdin`], [`Stdout`][`std::io::Stdout`], or [`Stderr`][`std::io::Stderr`]
/// because all operating systems have issues with them when put in non-blocking mode.
///
/// [timerfd]: https://github.com/smol-rs/async-io/blob/master/examples/linux-timerfd.rs
/// [inotify]: https://github.com/smol-rs/async-io/blob/master/examples/linux-inotify.rs
///
/// ### Concurrent I/O
///
/// Note that [`&Async<T>`][`Async`] implements [`AsyncRead`] and [`AsyncWrite`] if `&T`
/// implements those traits, which means tasks can concurrently read and write using shared
/// references.
///
/// But there is a catch: only one task can read a time, and only one task can write at a time. It
/// is okay to have two tasks where one is reading and the other is writing at the same time, but
/// it is not okay to have two tasks reading at the same time or writing at the same time. If you
/// try to do that, conflicting tasks will just keep waking each other in turn, thus wasting CPU
/// time.
///
/// Besides [`AsyncRead`] and [`AsyncWrite`], this caveat also applies to
/// [`poll_readable()`][`Async::poll_readable()`] and
/// [`poll_writable()`][`Async::poll_writable()`].
///
/// However, any number of tasks can be concurrently calling other methods like
/// [`readable()`][`Async::readable()`] or [`read_with()`][`Async::read_with()`].
///
/// ### Closing
///
/// Closing the write side of [`Async`] with [`close()`][`futures::AsyncWriteExt::close()`]
/// simply flushes. If you want to shutdown a TCP or Unix socket, use
/// [`Shutdown`][`std::net::Shutdown`].
///
