## Building

gst-plugins-rs relies on [cargo-c](https://github.com/lu-zero/cargo-c/) to
generate shared and static C libraries. It can be installed using:

```
$ cargo install cargo-c
```

Then you can easily build and test a specific plugin:

```
$ cargo cbuild -p gst-plugin-cdg
$ GST_PLUGIN_PATH="target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug:$GST_PLUGIN_PATH" gst-inspect-1.0 cdgdec
```

Replace `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` with your system's Rust target triple (`rustc -vV`).

The plugin can also be installed system-wide:

```
$ cargo cinstall -p gst-plugin-cdg --prefix=/usr
```

This will install the plugin to `/usr/lib/gstreamer-1.0`.
You can use `--libdir` to pass a custom `lib` directory
such as `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` for example.

Note that you can also just use `cargo` directly to build Rust static libraries
and shared C libraries. `cargo-c` is mostly useful to build static C libraries
and generate `pkg-config` files.

In case cargo complains about dependency versions after a `git pull`, `cargo update` may
be able to resolve those.
